Dear User, \
Welcome to the application **"Visit Blog"** ! 

You can find it here: 
- link: https://visitblog.netlify.app/ 
- code: https://github.com/AAPrikhodko/visitblog

Some notes:

1. You are already logged in with testing account "Joe Doe" and able to:
    - **read posts.** You may do it either from the main page where you can find the first 20 posts from the API listed chronologically or click on "eye" sign and open their details. 
    - **create new posts.** By clicking "Create post" button you will be redirected to the page where you can tell about you story 
    - **leave the comments under all the posts**
    - **edit your own posts.** You need to click to "edit" sign at the post card
    - **delete your own posts** 
2. The application has a responsive layout. It supports screen resolutions up to 375px (iPhone SE)
3. About stack technology. This app was created based on:
   - React library
   - React-query
   - Type Script
   - Ant Design library
   - SCSS preprocessor
4. Next steps to improve:
    - create user's personal account to be able to support multiple users (now user John Doe is hard codded)
    - add tags choose when creating the post (now tags are hard codded)
    - add infinite scrolling or pagination to main page and post page

Thank you for using "Visit blog" app!
